When opening a PR, add the Jira ticket ID.
Follow this pattern: [WEBRTC-XXX] - Title.
Always open PRs as drafts.
Use the format described at .github/pull_request_template.md, including a clear description of the changes, any relevant issue numbers, and testing instructions.

Don't change the verto message json structure without confirming first.
When making changes to the SDK, ensure that you update the demo application (TelnyxWebRTCDemo) accordingly to demonstrate the new functionality.
Follow the established architecture patterns for WebRTC, including peer connection management, ICE candidate handling, and call state management.
Ensure that all new features and bug fixes are accompanied by appropriate unit tests in the TelnyxRTCTests module.

Follow the Swift Style Guide for general Swift coding conventions.
Use SwiftUI for any new UI components implemented in the demo app.
Any SwiftUI view must include a .preview provider for visual inspection.
Ensure proper use of @State, @ObservedObject, @StateObject, and other SwiftUI property wrappers.

Do not run iOS tests manually; they are automatically run when a Pull Request is created.
However, if adding new unit tests, you can run specific test classes in Xcode to verify they work during development.

When working with WebRTC components, ensure proper cleanup of peer connections and media streams to prevent memory leaks.
Always handle audio permissions and device management properly when making changes to call functionality.
When modifying authentication flows, ensure both credential and token login methods are supported.
When adding push notification features, ensure proper integration with Apple Push Notification service (APNs).

Avoid descriptive comments, only add comments if the code is too complex.
Use meaningful variable and function names that make the code self-documenting.

Do not modify public SDK contracts unless explicitly requested or previously validated.
If a public contract is changed, document the change appropriately so other developers can understand it.
If the public contract is updated, ensure the README.md file is updated to reflect usage of the new version.
If SDK errors are modified, document them in docs-markdown/error-handling/error-handling.md (if applicable).
If WebRTC stats are modified, update the documentation in docs-markdown/webrtc-stats/webrtc-stats.md.

Check whether any changes are needed in the demo app to ensure it compiles correctly and apply them as necessary.
Any new files created must be added to the project structure to ensure the app builds successfully.
Avoid adding new third-party libraries unless explicitly requested.
Ensure any implemented code is compatible with the currently supported iOS version in the project.
If updating the deployment target is absolutely necessary, it must be validated first.
Prefer alternative implementations that do not require updating the iOS version.

When adding new public APIs, ensure they are properly documented with Swift documentation comments (///).
Maintain backward compatibility when possible, especially for public SDK interfaces.
Follow iOS-specific patterns for delegate protocols, completion handlers, and async/await where appropriate.
Ensure proper memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and avoid retain cycles.

Documentation formatting must be Mintlify-compatible:
Use backticks to format code expressions in Swift documentation comments (e.g., `MOS > 4.2` instead of MOS > 4.2).
Always use self-closing tags for HTML elements in markdown files (e.g., `<img />` and `<br />` instead of `<img>` and `</br>`).
Format numeric ranges, comparisons, and technical values as inline code using backticks.
When documenting enums, format case conditions and values with backticks for proper rendering.
After modifying Swift documentation comments in SDK files, regenerate markdown documentation using `fastlane generate_docs_markdown`.
Do not manually edit files under docs-markdown/enums/, docs-markdown/classes/, docs-markdown/structs/, or docs-markdown/protocols/ as they are auto-generated by SourceDocs.
Manual documentation files like docs-markdown/push-notification/*.md, docs-markdown/webrtc-stats/*.md, and docs-markdown/error-handling/*.md should follow the same Mintlify formatting rules.

Branch naming: start with feat/ fix/ chore/ depending on the case, then the ticket number. Like feat/WEBRTC-2877.
