**CLASS**

# `Call`

```swift
public class Call
```

A Call represents an audio or video communication session between two endpoints: WebRTC Clients, SIP clients, or phone numbers.
The Call object manages the entire lifecycle of a call, from initiation to termination, handling both outbound and inbound calls.

A Call object is created in two scenarios:
1. When you initiate a new outbound call using TxClient's newCall method
2. When you receive an inbound call through the TxClientDelegate's onIncomingCall callback

## Key Features
- Audio and video call support
- Call state management (NEW, CONNECTING, RINGING, ACTIVE, HELD, DONE)
- Mute/unmute functionality
- DTMF tone sending
- Custom headers support for both INVITE and ANSWER messages
- Call statistics reporting when debug mode is enabled

## Examples
### Creating an Outbound Call:
```swift
   // Initialize the client
   self.telnyxClient = TxClient()
   self.telnyxClient?.delegate = self

   // Connect the client (see TxClient documentation for connection options)
   self.telnyxClient?.connect(....)

   // Create and initiate a call
   self.currentCall = try self.telnyxClient?.newCall(
       callerName: "John Doe",           // The name to display for the caller
       callerNumber: "155531234567",     // The caller's phone number
       destinationNumber: "18004377950", // The target phone number or SIP URI
       callId: UUID.init(),              // Unique identifier for the call
       clientState: nil,                 // Optional client state information
       customHeaders: [:]                // Optional custom SIP headers
   )
```

### Handling an Incoming Call:
```swift
class CallHandler: TxClientDelegate {
    var activeCall: Call?

    func initTelnyxClient() {
        let client = TxClient()
        client.delegate = self
        client.connect(....)
    }

    func onIncomingCall(call: Call) {
        // Store the call reference
        self.activeCall = call

        // Option 1: Auto-answer the call
        call.answer()

        // Option 2: Answer with custom headers
        call.answer(customHeaders: ["X-Custom-Header": "Value"])

        // Option 3: Reject the call
        // call.hangup()
    }
}
```

## Properties
### `onCallQualityChange`

```swift
public var onCallQualityChange: ((CallQualityMetrics) -> Void)?
```

Callback for real-time call quality metrics
This is triggered whenever new WebRTC statistics are available

### `inviteCustomHeaders`

```swift
public internal(set) var inviteCustomHeaders: [String:String]?
```

Custom headers received from the WebRTC INVITE message.
These headers are passed during call initiation and can contain application-specific information.
Format should be ["X-Header-Name": "Value"] where header names must start with "X-".

### `answerCustomHeaders`

```swift
public internal(set) var answerCustomHeaders: [String:String]?
```

Custom headers received from the WebRTC ANSWER message.
These headers are passed during call acceptance and can contain application-specific information.
Format should be ["X-Header-Name": "Value"] where header names must start with "X-".

### `sessionId`

```swift
public internal(set) var sessionId: String?
```

The unique session identifier for the current WebRTC connection.
This ID is established during client connection and remains constant for the session duration.

### `telnyxSessionId`

```swift
public internal(set) var telnyxSessionId: UUID?
```

The unique Telnyx session identifier for this call.
This ID can be used to track the call in Telnyx's systems and logs.

### `telnyxLegId`

```swift
public internal(set) var telnyxLegId: UUID?
```

The unique Telnyx leg identifier for this call.
A call can have multiple legs (e.g., in call transfers). This ID identifies this specific leg.

### `debug`

```swift
public internal(set) var debug: Bool = false
```

Enables WebRTC statistics reporting for debugging purposes.
When true, the SDK will collect and send WebRTC statistics to Telnyx servers.
This is useful for troubleshooting call quality issues.

### `enableQualityMetrics`

```swift
public internal(set) var enableQualityMetrics: Bool = false
```

Enables CallQuality Metrics for Call

### `forceRelayCandidate`

```swift
public internal(set) var forceRelayCandidate: Bool = false
```

Controls whether the SDK should force TURN relay for peer connections.
When enabled, the SDK will only use TURN relay candidates for ICE gathering,
which prevents the "local network access" permission popup from appearing.

### `callInfo`

```swift
public var callInfo: TxCallInfo?
```

Contains essential information about the current call including:
- callId: Unique identifier for this call
- callerName: Display name of the caller
- callerNumber: Phone number or SIP URI of the caller
See `TxCallInfo` for complete details.

### `callState`

```swift
public var callState: CallState = .NEW
```

The current state of the call. Possible values:
- NEW: Call object created but not yet initiated
- CONNECTING: Outbound call is being established
- RINGING: Incoming call waiting to be answered
- ACTIVE: Call is connected and media is flowing
- HELD: Call is temporarily suspended
- DONE: Call has ended

The state changes are notified through the `CallProtocol` delegate.

### `isMuted`

```swift
public var isMuted: Bool
```

Indicates whether the local audio is currently muted.
- Returns: `true` if the call is muted (audio track disabled)
- Returns: `false` if the call is not muted (audio track enabled)

Use `muteAudio()` and `unmuteAudio()` to change the mute state.
